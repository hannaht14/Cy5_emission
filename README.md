# Investigating Cy5 Dye Emission Enhancement with Plasmonic Nanoantennas

## Overview
This project investigates the enhancement of Cy5 dye molecule emission using plasmonic nanoantennas, applying a modified Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (PAINT) technique. The study focuses on optimizing nanoantenna structures to improve electric field strength and radiative rates for super-resolution microscopy applications.

## Objective
To analyze and compare the emission enhancement of Cy5 dye molecules when coupled with optimized plasmonic nanoantennas versus conventional bowtie antennas. The goal is to determine geometric factors influencing electric field enhancement, which can contribute to more sensitive, higher-resolution imaging techniques.

## Methodology
- **Nanoantenna Characterization**: Fabricated nanoantennas were analyzed using SEM imaging and scattering spectra to determine plasmon resonance properties.
- **Super-Resolution Microscopy**: Applied the PAINT technique to monitor Cy5 dye emission at the nanoscale, capturing fluorescence data over thousands of frames.
- **Data Analysis**: Compared emission intensity, track durations, and spatial resolution between optimized nanoantenna and bowtie structures.

## Key Findings
- Significant emission enhancement was observed with plasmonic nanoantennas, improving brightness and spatial resolution.
- Contrary to expectations, optimized structures did not outperform conventional bowtie antennas, attributed to limited data. Further experiments with larger sample sizes need to be done.
- The geometry and spectral overlap of nanoantennas were critical in influencing dye emission properties.
